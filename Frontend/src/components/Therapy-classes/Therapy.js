              Music can heal, literally. Studies have revealed that music
              releases endorphins, which can ease pain, or even improve health
              outcomes. <br /> <br />
              When the bodies systems become stressed or compromised certain
              frequencies become out of tune and everything can become affected.
              With sound healing, utilising various instruments and tones, the
              body is gently brought back to its natural state of harmony.
